												<br><br>
												Although I was not particularly keen into going into the Finance industry I was able to learn better communication and also being able

												During my time at St Pauls I was also a mentor for the years below giving tips on revision, handling exam stress and preparing for University applications.
												I was also able to achieve the Edexcel Level 3 Algebra Award with a mark of 87/90.

												<br><br>
												Throughout this period I was exposed to what it was like to work in a fast paced team environment and was hooked instantly.
												I immediately realised that out of all the different areas I worked on at the time, I was always found Software fields being
												the most exciting which I took note of.

											Electronic and Information Engineering as I thought it was an amazing middle ground for both Hardware and Software.
											<br><br>
											This was an amazing choice as I would share my modules with both Computer Science students and also Electrical Engineering students.
											Because of this, I have been to take in the best of both courses and also have a deeper and better understanding of Software at a fundemental level.
											Imperial also allowed me to be certain for my passion for Software and Programming and solidify my career path.

											and also adapt a different way of thinking for fields I'm not familiar with (e.g., 3D modelling, music, UI/UX, design, etc..).
											<br><br>
											I also reguarly team up with other Game Developers, Pixel Artists and Music Composers from time to time
											to try to create games for fun GameJam competitions.

											<br><br>
											I took up a job as a Remote Academic Tutor at MyTutor.co.uk which I was then able to help tutor and mentor multiple students in both A-Levels
											and GCSEs. 
											<br><br>
											My tutoring primarily consisted of scientific subjects as it is my most proficient fields however I was also open to tutoriing other 
											non-scientific subjects. I enjoyed seeing the improvements of all my students and the gradual increase in effort and interest each of them
											would bring to my lessons as time went on.

											<div class="ag-timeline-card_desc2">
												During my applications for a 6 month industrial placement I applied to a company named THG which is a British e-commerce retailer.
												I applied and was hooked upon my first interaction with the team. I decided to pick THG as I was told it would be Research
												and Development in a mostly Full-Stack Software field. I was hooked as I knew I would be able to experience what it would be like to
												research, develop and maintain code that could potentially have a significant impact on the company. I also wanted to challenge myself
												as I have never done any full-stack development and loved learning new concepts and skills to improve my Software Engineering skills.
											<br><br>
												At my time at THG I was able to learn new frameworks such as Vue.js, Nuxt.js, Tailwind CSS, AWS Cloud, Calibre, Kubernetes and many more
												which allowed me to broaden my knowledge and become a better Software Engineer. I was also able to experience what it would be like to work
												in a team environment as a Software Engineer. This is because from the very beginning it was made clear to me that although I would be helped
												initially, I would be treated no different than any of the other regular Software Engineers in the team. This was amazing experience and I am
												very grateful to have met such an amazing team who have mentored me and have also made my Internship an amazing experience.
											<br><br>
												During my internship I was also able to work on a subsection of work called Prefetching which was able to improve some of the Product List page
												load times by up to 6x. Due to this improvement I was able to demo my work to the CTO of THG Schalk Van De Merwe which turned out to be a success
												and is implemented on the live site to date.
